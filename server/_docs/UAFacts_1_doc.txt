Konovalets' activities raised Kremlin fears of the OUN's penetration into the Soviet Union. On 23 May 1938 he was assassinated in Rotterdam by a bomb concealed in a box of chocolates disguised as a present from a close friend. The friend was actually an NKVD agent who had infiltrated the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists: Pavel Sudoplatov, who on a recent visit to the Soviet Union had been personally ordered by Joseph Stalin to assassinate Konovalets in retaliation for the 1933 assassination of a diplomat at the Soviet consulate in Lviv.

Sudoplatov, after a period of training, had slipped into Finland in July 1935, using the alias "Pavel Gridgdenko". According to Sudoplatov, Stalin had told him: "This is not just an act of revenge, although Konovalets is an agent of German fascism. Our goal is to behead the movement of Ukrainian fascism on the eve of war and force these gangsters to annihilate each other in a struggle for power."
