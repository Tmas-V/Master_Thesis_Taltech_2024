Here's how you can play Hangman:\n\n1. One player thinks of a word and draws a number of dashes on a piece of paper, each representing a letter in the word. For example, if the word is \"hangman,\" the player would draw \"_ _ _ _ _ _ _\" on the paper.\n\n2. The other player starts guessing letters one at a time. If the guessed letter is in the word, the player who thought of the word fills in the corresponding dashes with that letter. If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman is drawn (e.g., a head, body, arms, legs).\n\n3. The guessing player continues to guess letters until they either guess the word correctly or make a certain number of incorrect guesses (usually represented by the full hangman figure being drawn).\n\n4. The game ends when the guessing player correctly guesses the word or when the hangman figure is complete.\n\n5. Players can decide on the number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game ends.\n\nHangman is a fun and challenging game that can be played with friends or family. It's a great way to test your vocabulary and guessing skills!",

For this reason, Kushiro was considered a valuable target for the Tsars during the Russo-Japanese Wars, but it only became a really important port during the 1920s with the growth of commercial fishing, for which its reliable freedom from ice reduced costs.",
