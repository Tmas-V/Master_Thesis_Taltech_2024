Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples.Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi.

		"Kushiro has been an important port because it is more reliably ice-free during winter than alternative Russian Far East warm-water ports such as Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky or other ports in Hokkaido such as Hakodate, which occasionally do freeze for short periods due to the lower salinity of the Sea of Japan. For this reason, Kushiro was considered a valuable target for the Tsars during the Russo-Japanese Wars, but it only became a really important port during the 1920s with the growth of commercial fishing, for which its reliable freedom from ice reduced costs.",

		"Konovalets' activities raised Kremlin fears of the OUN's penetration into the Soviet Union. On 23 May 1938 he was assassinated in Rotterdam by a bomb concealed in a box of chocolates disguised as a present from a close friend. The friend was actually an NKVD agent who had infiltrated the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists: Pavel Sudoplatov, who on a recent visit to the Soviet Union had been personally ordered by Joseph Stalin to assassinate Konovalets in retaliation for the 1933 assassination of a diplomat at the Soviet consulate in Lviv.\n\nSudoplatov, after a period of training, had slipped into Finland in July 1935, using the alias \"Pavel Gridgdenko\". According to Sudoplatov, Stalin had told him: \"This is not just an act of revenge, although Konovalets is an agent of German fascism. Our goal is to behead the movement of Ukrainian fascism on the eve of war and force these gangsters to annihilate each other in a struggle for power.\"",

If the guessed letter is not in the word, the player adds a body part to a stick figure (starting with the head, body, arms, and legs) for each incorrect guess.\n5. The game continues until the guessing player correctly guesses the word or makes too many incorrect guesses, resulting in a complete stick figure (hangman) being drawn.\n6. The guessing player wins if they guess the word before the hangman is complete, and the word-choosing player wins if the hangman is complete before the word is guessed.\n\nIt's a fun and challenging game that tests your vocabulary and guessing skills!",

According to Sudoplatov, Stalin had told him: \"This is not just an act of revenge, although Konovalets is an agent of German fascism.

		"Konovalets' activities raised Kremlin fears of the OUN's penetration into the Soviet Union. On 23 May 1938 he was assassinated in Rotterdam by a bomb concealed in a box of chocolates disguised as a present from a close friend. The friend was actually an NKVD agent who had infiltrated the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists: Pavel Sudoplatov, who on a recent visit to the Soviet Union had been personally ordered by Joseph Stalin to assassinate Konovalets in retaliation for the 1933 assassination of a diplomat at the Soviet consulate in Lviv.\n\nSudoplatov, after a period of training, had slipped into Finland in July 1935, using the alias \"Pavel Gridgdenko\". According to Sudoplatov, Stalin had told him: \"This is not just an act of revenge, although Konovalets is an agent of German fascism. Our goal is to behead the movement of Ukrainian fascism on the eve of war and force these gangsters to annihilate each other in a struggle for power.\""
